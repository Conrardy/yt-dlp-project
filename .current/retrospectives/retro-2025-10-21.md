### 🎯 Session Objective

Build a comprehensive CLI tool to extract audio from YouTube videos using AI-generated code with a structured development process.

---

## 📋 Development Process Overview

### Initial Setup & Knowledge Transfer

- **Seed Knowledge Provided**: Initial domain expertise and requirements
- **Planning Phase**: Created structured development plan (`init.plan.md`)
- **Knowledge Base**: Established `knowledge.md` for domain-specific information

### 🔄 Development Methodology: Micro-Commits in Chat Mode

#### Process Design

1. **Two-Window Approach**:
   - **Agent Window**: AI performs development tasks
   - **Control Window**: Human manages process updates and oversight

2. **Controlled Progression**:
   - **Phase 1**: Restricted AI mode - human approval required
   - **Phase 2**: Auto-enabled AI - autonomous git commits and Python execution

3. **Todo-Driven Development**:
   - Implemented task tracking system
   - Clear implementation flow control
   - Progress visibility throughout development

---

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture Delivered

- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns across multiple components
  - `src/main.py` - CLI interface and argument parsing
  - `src/config.py` - Configuration management system
  - `src/audio_downloader.py` - Core download functionality
  - `src/metadata_extractor.py` - Video metadata extraction

### Key Features Implemented

- ✅ High-quality MP3 audio extraction (320 kbps)
- ✅ Comprehensive metadata extraction and storage
- ✅ Flexible CLI with multiple commands (`download`, `info`, `config`)
- ✅ Robust error handling and logging system
- ✅ Batch processing capabilities
- ✅ Configurable output directories and settings
- ✅ Progress tracking with visual indicators

### Technical Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.13, yt-dlp, FFmpeg
- **CLI**: argparse with subcommands
- **Configuration**: JSON-based with validation
- **Logging**: Multi-level logging (console + file)
- **Testing**: Automated test suite
