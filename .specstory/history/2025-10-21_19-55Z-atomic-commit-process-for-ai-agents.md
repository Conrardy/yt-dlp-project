I'll help you define a process for instructing an AI agent to perform atomic commits at a regular pace for easier development flow control and review. Let me update your chat mode configuration to include this process. 
```

```
Now let me add additional sections for advanced AI agent instruction patterns: 
```

```
I've enhanced your micro-commits chat mode configuration with a comprehensive process for instructing AI agents to perform atomic commits at regular intervals. The key additions include:

**Core Framework:**
- Clear commit decision matrix based on change size and completion status
- Automated self-prompting questions every 10-15 minutes
- Specific commit triggers and anti-patterns to avoid
- Structured communication protocol for progress tracking

**Quality Control:**
- Pre-commit quality gates (compilation, tests, linting)
- Recovery procedures for common problems
- Success metrics to monitor adherence to the process

**Flow Control Benefits:**
- Each commit is a safe rollback point
- Reviewers can focus on individual logical changes
- Progress is easily measurable and trackable
- Issues are caught early in the development cycle

This process ensures AI agents maintain a steady development pace while creating clean, reviewable git history that makes debugging and collaboration much easier.
